    <p>We have carefully planned our guest list. If your invitation includes "and Guest," please feel free to bring someone. Otherwise, we kindly ask that it just be you.</p>

    <p>While we love your little ones, we've decided to make this an adults-only celebration. We hope this gives you a night to relax and celebrate with us!</p>
