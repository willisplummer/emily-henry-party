    <h2 id="travel">Travel Information</h2>
    <h3>Closest Airports</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Albany International Airport (45min drive)</li>
      <li>New York Stewart International Airport (1h10min drive)</li>
      <li>JFK/LGA/Newark (2-3h drive or 3-4h train)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Transportation Options</h3>
    <p>The best way to get here is to drive, but we are only 20min from the Hudson Amtrak station. If you travel by train and need help figuring out rides, let either Henry or Emily know!</p>
    
    <h3>Parking Details</h3>
    <p>The party will be at our house in a residential area, so please be respectful when parking and do not block our neighbors driveways! We also recommend carpooling, both to limit the amount of cars in the neighborhood and to reduce the number of people driving back to hotels after drinking ❤️</p>
    
    <h2 id="lodging">Lodging Options</h2>
    
    <h3>Stewart House</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>2 N Water St, Athens, NY 12015</strong> -- 5 min walk<br>
      We're almost hesitant to suggest it because it only has 9 rooms and will book up super quickly, but if you can, grab a room here! It's right in town, right on the water and super beautiful. If you miss out on a room, don't worry, you can join us for drinks at their River Garden on Friday night and we encourage you to grab dinner inside at the beautiful bar or dining room afterward.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Camptown</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
      <p><strong>810 Co Rd 23B, Leeds, NY 12451</strong> -- 10 min drive<br>
      Super cute motel and cabin resort. You can book either a private cabin or room, and they have a really nice pool & pool bar as well. The attached restaurant, Casa Susanna, serves delicious Oaxacan food and is very cozy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">

    <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>Will there really be swimming?</h3>
    <p>Weather permitting, yes! We have a 4' above ground pool, so no one will be doing laps, but we'll have pool floats and encourage guests to enjoy one of our favorite parts of the house. If you're planning to swim, please bring your own towel and a change of clothes to keep yourself comfortable.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I get there late? What if I have to leave early?</h3>
    <p>No problem! Feel free to participate in the parts of the celebration that you can. We'll be so glad to see you :)</p>
    
    <h3>Can I bring a gift?</h3>
    <p>If you really want to, sure! But, there's absolutely no pressure to bring a gift and we do not have a registry. We are fortunate to already have a well-stocked home and full life. Your presence at our celebration means the world to us!</p>
    
    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
    <p>Whatever you want! Bring a swimsuit if you want to enjoy the pool, and otherwise whatever makes you feel comfortable and celebratory. We'll be outside so it will likely be warm. And we'll be on a lawn, so skip the stilettos.</p>
    
    <h3>What if it rains?</h3>
    <p>Fingers crossed it doesn't! But just in case, we'll have a tent outside, and can move the party inside if needed.</p>
